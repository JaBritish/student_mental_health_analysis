# Social Media and Mental Health: A Data Analysis Project
# Overview
This project investigates the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes(depression and anxiety) among university students. The analysis uses logistic regression modelling to uncover patterns, risk factors, and behavioral predictors that are statistically associated with mental health status.
The dataset consists of 389 survey responses collected from university students including information on demographics, social media use habits, and indicators of anxiety and depression. 
# Objectives
- Explore how social media usage is associated with depression and anxiety
- Identify key predictors of poor mental health outcomes
- Fit and interpret binary and multinomial logistic regression models
- Visualize predicted probabilities for predicted outcomes
- Showcase practical data science and statistical modeling skills
