# student_mental_health_analysis
In this project, we seek to explore the effect of social media use on the mental health of students. We analyze various aspects of social media such as frequency of use, type of platform, content type, purpose of use, and average duration of use per day while for the mental health outcomes we assess the levels of depression and anxiety.
